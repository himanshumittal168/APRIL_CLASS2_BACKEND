                3.1 Mongodb Compass

q1. What is Db
a1. db-> DataBase - SQL, NON SQL
                    SQL-Structure Query Language
                    Data is stored in Tables   ->My SQl
                    NON SQL->  MongoDB
                
q3 What is mongoose  ->write in db, connect to db, update in db
    Express-Server---------(MONGOOSE)----------------Db(MongoDB)
    ODM-object Data Modelling

    Node.js -Data is treated as object  // JSON
    Mongodb-data is treated as document

3.1 MongoDB Compass-> GUI graphical User Interface 
3.2 Shell - Command ,it is difficult

    
IMPORTANT
<!-- MVC -->

MODEL->Represent the structure of data,   (SCHEMA)
       Formate and constraint with which it is stored.

Controller -> Controls the request of user and generated appropriate response, 

View -> What is presented to user, 
        Ultilize the model and present data in form user want to see.
